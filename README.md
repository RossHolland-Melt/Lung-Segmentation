# Lung-Segmentation ü´Å

## Introduction
This project focuses on the application of U-Net, a convolutional neural network, for segmenting lung masks in chest X-rays. Utilizing the "Chest Xray Masks and Labels" dataset from Kaggle, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of lung mask segmentation, which is crucial in medical image analysis.

## Dataset Description
The "Chest Xray Masks and Labels" dataset from Kaggle comprises 7047 high-resolution chest X-ray images (1024x1024 pixels) and corresponding expert-annotated lung masks. The images are in DICOM format, a standard for medical imaging, with mask annotations in PNG format. The dataset is pre-divided into training, validation, and test sets, facilitating the development and evaluation of segmentation models. Sourced from the "Shenzhen Hospital X-ray set" and the "Montgomery County X-ray set," this dataset is an excellent resource for deep learning applications in medical imaging, particularly for lung segmentation tasks. The dataset is available under a CC0: Public Domain license, allowing unrestricted use.

## Environment and Dependencies
To run this project, the following environment and dependencies are required:
- Python 3.x
